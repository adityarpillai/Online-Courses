1.  What’s stdint.h? 
stdint.h is a header class used to prevent the actual size of data types from varying across different systems and to set 
exact sizes for data types.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t ensures that the data types created are an unsigned integer with exactly 8 bits,
an unsigned integer with exactly 32 bits, a signed integer with exactly 32 bits, and an unsigned integer with exactly 16 bits,
respectively, to prevent data types from taking up more/less space than intended.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
A "BYTE" has 1 byte; a "DWORD" has 4 bytes; a "LONG" has 4 bytes; a "WORD" has 2 bytes.

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file 
    formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
As per the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure, a BMP file must start with "BM," which is 0x4d42.

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Whereas bfSize represents the size of the entire bitmap file in bytes, biSize represents the size of just the BITMAPINFOHEADER 
structure in bytes.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
According to the documentation for the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure, a negative biHeight (typically the height of the bitmap in
pixels) indicates a top-down DIB that cannot be compressed. Thus, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount defines the number of bits-per-pixel in a bmp file.

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
fopen may return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c if the file cannot be found to read from or if there is not enough memory to open
the file within memory.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
fread only needs to read 1 element of the size of a BITMAPFILEHEADER, BITMAPINFOHEADER, or pixel and store it to a place in memory.
There is no need to read beyond that specific struct / element when saving it to a memory location.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
It would assign:
   (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4
 = (4 - (3 * 3 % 4) % 4
 = (4 - (9 % 4) % 4
 = (4 - 1 % 4)
 = (4 - 1)
 = 3
 
11. What does fseek do?
fessek sets the file position indicator for the stream / file indicated.
In the case of the program:

>   // skip over padding, if any
>   fseek(inptr, padding, SEEK_CUR);

fseek offsets the file position indicator in the stream "inptr" by the integer padding respective to the current position indicator.
In other words, fseek skips the set amount by padding and sets the file position indicator indicative of the next row.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
SEEK_CUR is a constant integer defined in the file containing fseek. SEEK_CUR indicates that the offset by fseek is relative to the 
current position indicator rather than to the start- or end-of-the-file.
