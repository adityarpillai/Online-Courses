# Online-Courses
My programming from online courses I've completed.

Here is a quick list of the courses:

## CS50x by Harvard University

https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, is Harvard's largest course.

NOTE: Most of this course takes place on the online IDE Cloud9. Thus, I was copying most of my code to this repository, but for later projects with more dependencies, it became increasingly difficult to copy everything over. Thus, most of the later week assignments are not on this repository.

## Algorithmic Toolbox by the University of California San Diego

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

## Algorithms, Part I by Princeton University

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

## Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/python

This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3.

## Python Data Structures

https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data

This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. This course covers Python 3.

Note: Most of this course didn't involve programming on my laptop, so I don't have much of the code that I wrote on GitHub.
