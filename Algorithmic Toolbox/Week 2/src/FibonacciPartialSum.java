 *  Description:    Given two non-negative integers 𝑚 and 𝑛, where 𝑚 ≤ 𝑛, find
 *                  the last digit of the sum 𝐹𝑚 + 𝐹𝑚+1 + · · · + 𝐹𝑛.
 *
 *  Compilation:    javac FibonacciPartialSum.java
 *  Execution:      java FibonacciPartialSum
 *
 *  Input:          The input consists of two non-negative integers 𝑚 and 𝑛
 *                  separated by a space.
 *  Constraints:    0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10^18
 *  Output:         The last digit of 𝐹𝑚 + 𝐹𝑚+1 + · · · + 𝐹𝑛 on a single line.
 *
 *  Dependencies:   java.util.Scanner
 *  Package:        None
