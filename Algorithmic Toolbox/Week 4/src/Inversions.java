 *  Description:    An inversion of a sequence 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1 is a
 *                  pair of indices 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 < 𝑛 such that 𝑎𝑖 > 𝑎𝑗 . The
 *                  number of inversions of a sequence in some sense measures
 *                  how close the sequence is to being sorted. For example, a
 *                  sorted (in non-descending order) sequence contains no
 *                  inversions at all, while in a sequence sorted in
 *                  descending order any two elements constitute an
 *                  inversion (for a total of 𝑛(𝑛 − 1)/2 inversions).
 *
 *                  The goal in this problem is to count the number of
 *                  inversions of a given sequence.
 *
 *  Compilation:    javac Inversions.java
 *  Execution:      java Inversions
 *
 *  Input:          The first line contains an integer 𝑛, the next one
 *                  contains a sequence of integers 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1.
 *  Constraints:    1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105 , 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛.
 *  Output:         Output the number of inversions in the sequence.
