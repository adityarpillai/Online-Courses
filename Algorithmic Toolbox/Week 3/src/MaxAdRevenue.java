 *  Description:    Given two sequences a1, a2, ..., an (ai is the profit per
 *                  click of the i-th ad) and b1, b2, ..., bn (bi is the average
 *                  number of clicks per day i-th slot), we need to partition
 *                  them into n pairs (ai, bj) such that the sum of their
 *                  products is maximized.
 *
 *  Compilation:    javac MaxAdRevenue.java
 *  Execution:      java MaxAdRevenue
 *
 *  Input:          The first line contains an integer n, the second contains a
 *                  sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an, the third one contains
 *                  a sequence of integers b1, b2, ..., bn.
 *  Constraints:    1 ‚â§ ùëõ ‚â§ 10^3; ‚àí10^5 ‚â§ ùëéùëñ, ùëèùëñ ‚â§ 10^5 for all 1 ‚â§ ùëñ ‚â§ ùëõ.
 *  Output:         Outputs the maximum value of ai * bi for all i.
